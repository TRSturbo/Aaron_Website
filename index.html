                    <h2>Professional About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Experienced Engineering Manager and seasoned developer with a passion for building impactful web and mobile experiences. Over a year and a half as an Engineering Manager, and more than three years in team leadership roles, I've had the privilege of leading diverse teams, including larger Front-End and smaller Mobile teams, to deliver high-quality solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My management approach encompasses hiring, mentoring, performance management, and shaping technical roadmaps, all while fostering a collaborative and positive team culture. I thrive in consistently improving of our team's intake process for new work and collaborating closely with stakeholders to significantly streamline project definition and delivery, ensuring timely and high-quality solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While my focus has shifted predominantly towards management, I maintain a strong understanding of web UI, web frameworks, and both native and hybrid mobile app development. I'm adept at full-scale application development, establishing best practices, and leveraging Agile methodologies to drive successful project delivery.

                    <h2>Personal Side</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the world of code and management, I'm an avid enthusiast of continuous learning and personal growth. When I'm not solving technical challenges or leading teams, you'll likely find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or diving into interesting technical podcasts and books.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm passionate about mentorship, believing that sharing knowledge is key to both personal and collective growth. My interests extend beyond tech, including being a dedicated father, automation and finding creative ways to blend technology with personal passions. One example is my avid passion for smart home configuration and development to make every day life at home convenient and secure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lifelong learning is more than a professional motto for me - it's a way of life. Whether it's picking up a new programming language, exploring emerging tech trends, or understanding the human side of technology, I'm always eager to expand my horizons.
